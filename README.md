# Conflexian

Conflexian is an old project that evolves website layouts, updated to use flexbox instead of tables.

Each of the layouts has it's own genome, they are bred and evolve over time. Essentially it's a Genetic Algorithm (with a sprinkling of simulated annealing) whose method of supervised learning is human interaction.

Press 'n' for a new layout, 'l' to let the system know you like something, and 's' to see all the designs you've liked so far.
